This project is a clone of the Disney website. I've always been impressed with the styling and responsiveness and I attempted to create it from scratch. This site is to portray my abilities and is in no way trying to represent itself as Disney. I incorporated React.js, redux-toolkit, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

GETTING STARTED: 
1. Clone the Project
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm run dev to start client and server
4. If you wish to test cart functionality then use test@email.com to sign in
5. Have Fun!

I'm always adding new features and content. Next goals are to convert project to Typescript and add testing with Jest
