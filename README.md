# dalt-wisney-ecommerce

This project is a clone of the Disney website. I've always been impressed with the styling and responsiveness and I attempted to create it from scratch. I incorporated React.js, redux-toolkit, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.


Run the project by cloning and running npm run dev in the console to launch the front and back end.
